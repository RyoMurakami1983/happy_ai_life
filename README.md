## Quality Gate

This repository uses a GitHub Actions quality gate on every PR:

| Check | Tool | Trigger |
|-------|------|---------|
| Secret detection | [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) | Always enabled |
| Markdown lint | [textlint](https://textlint.github.io/) | Uncomment in `.github/workflows/quality.yml` when needed |

### Adding textlint (for Markdown-heavy repos)

1. Uncomment the `textlint` job in `.github/workflows/quality.yml`
2. Copy `.textlintrc.json` and `package.json` from the [github-quality-gate-setup skill](https://github.com/RyoMurakami1983/skills_repository)
3. Run `npm install`
4. Add `textlint` as a required status check in Branch Protection settings

### Customizing gitleaks allowlist

Edit `.gitleaks.toml` to add allowlist entries for documentation example placeholders
that should not be treated as real secrets.
